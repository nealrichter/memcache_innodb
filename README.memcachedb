What is MemcacheDB?
*******************
MemcacheDB is a distributed key-value storage system designed for persistent. It is NOT a cache solution, but a persistent storage engine for fast and reliable key-value based object storage and retrieval. It conforms to memcache protocol(not completed, see below), so any memcached client can have connectivity with it. MemcacheDB uses Berkeley DB as a storing backend, so lots of features including transaction and replication are supported.

Some Warning
************
Expire time has been discarded in MemcacheDB(we are for persistent:p), so you should not use any corresponding features of clients. The daemon does nothing while you give a expire time to an item.
